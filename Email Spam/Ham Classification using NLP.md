Project Title: Email Spam/Ham Classification using NLP

Problem Statement: The problem was to develop a machine learning model that could accurately classify emails as spam or ham based on their text content.

Approach: The approach was to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Sentiment anaylis to extract features from the text data, and then train a classification model on these features. The following steps were taken:

    1. Data Collection: Collected a dataset of  emails from various sources, which were labeled as either spam or ham.
    2. Data Preprocessing: Performed text preprocessing tasks such as removing stop words, stemming and lemmatization, and converting text to lowercase.
    3. Feature Extraction: NLP techniques like TF-IDF and Bag of Words were used to extract features from the preprocessed text data.
    4. Model Training: Train a machine learning model, such as Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression, on the extracted features and the labeled data.
    5. Model Evaluation: Evaluated the final model's performance using metrics such as accuracy and precision.

Tools and Technologies Used: The project was implemented using Python programming language and the following libraries:
    • Pandas
    • Scikit-learn  for train & test split, feature extration,  logistic Regression and accuracy

Results: The final model achieved an accuracy of 96%, which means it can accurately classify emails as spam or ham.
